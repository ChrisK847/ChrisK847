Chris Klest here. At this time, I am interested in making videogames and websites. Most of my experience with programming has been within MS Excel, with VBA 7.1 as well as Powershell. To a much lesser degree, I have some experience with C, Javascript/html/css and Java, though, I will be getting more into these and other languages soon.
